Dear Riz,

As the holiday season approaches and we reflect on the past year, I wanted 
to take a moment to express my appreciation for your hard work and dedication. 
You have been an invaluable member of our team and 
I am grateful to be able to work alongside you.

As we celebrate Christmas and ring in the New Year, 
I wish you and your loved ones all the joy, happiness, and success 
that you deserve. May the coming year bring you all the blessings you 
desire and may you continue to thrive in all your endeavors.

Thank you for being such a great workmate and I look forward 
to continuing to work with you in the coming year.

Sincerely,

JV
